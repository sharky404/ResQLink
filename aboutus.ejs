        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p> Natural disasters happen unexpectedly, taking people by surprise, leaving individuals and communities
            vulnerable.
            Disasters may happen to anyone, anywhere. Our project aims to create a comprehensive online platform
            dedicated to natural disaster management, designed to facilitate operations and provide critical information
            during emergencies.
            By harnessing technology, we strive to bridge the gap between affected communities and the support they
            need, ensuring timely assistance.</p>
        <p>
        <h3><b>Key Features</b></h3>
        Rescue Link is a revolutionary platform to assist individuals and communities during natural disasters.
        The website contains all information required in a single place, right from helplines, instructions for
        emergency preparedness, safety protocols, and preparation strategies to first aid techniques and medical
        guidance.
        Rescue Link helps users access weather alerts as and when required. Instilling a sense of awareness of possible
        calamities is vital for taking apt measures.
        The website provides a community interface that connects NGOs and Volunteers to regions that require support.
        A trauma care chat and helpline are always available on the Rescue Link website.</p>
        <p>
        <h3><b>Our mission in the Real World</b></h3>
        Rescue Link is a project we have undertaken to make an impact in the world, no matter how small.
        Natural calamities have struck in the most unexpected ways.
        Our mission is to create a user-friendly and accessible website that serves everyone, regardless of location.
        Funding for rations, shelters, rebuilding efforts, and medical assistance is primarily sourced through
        donations.
